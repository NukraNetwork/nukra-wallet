Simply download this repository and run the `Nukra Wallet.exe` file. If you get a warning from Windows Defender, click on `More info` and then `Run anyway`.

When you run the wallet for the first time it will ask you if you want to change the installation directory, we recommend that you do not do this and leave the option checked by default, Nukra Wallet will be installed to `%APPDATA%/Nukra` (C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\Nukra)
